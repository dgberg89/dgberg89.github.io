title: 1st Week at Metis Data Science Bootcamp - Start of a Crazy Journey!
---

Take a lifelong options trader who hasn't been to school in 25 years and throw him into a data science bootcamp to see what happens.
That's the journey I began last Monday when I began a three month intensive Data Science Bootcamp at Metis in San Francisco.  For the next three months, I'll be in class from 9-6 every day with countless hours of homework on the side.  What brought me on this journey and what are the takeaways after the first week?

What brought me here was a lifelong fascination with data and data analytics, and the understanding that Big Data Science is indeed the wave of the future.  The financial industry is the perfect example of that, with trading and investment being a primary beneficiary of big data analytics.  I have been surrounded by quantitative analysts throughout my career who have always shown me their work and helped me with models, but I've never actually learned how to "do" the work myself!  So as one must always continue to better themself and keep on learning, this was the perfect time for me to enter the fray of the bootcamp!

I expected the course to be difficult but focused, interesting, and even fun, and the first week has not disappointed!  The sheer amount of work we had the first week was impressive, from learning advanced coding techniques to working on a group data project that was presented on Friday, just 5 days in!

The amazing thing, however, is how we're all in this together.  I found that all of my other classmates, while coming from different backgrounds, were all on the same page as me.  Strong in some areas, a work-in-progress in others.  This was a welcome surprise as I figured I'd be at a distinct disadvantage given my age.  Not the case at all.  My classmates are very well distributed in age, background, and experience, and it has been fantastic getting to know them.

The culmination of my week was doing the first of many Investigations, a short presentation on a passion topic of my choice.,  I chose to do Data Science in Baseball, and the research was fascinating.  I know the game well, and understand its statistics and analytics, and yet I discovered new things being done in the game that I was only vaguely aware of.  Putting statistics behind things I've often thought about is just a great learning experience, and really why I'm here in the first place.

So to sum it up, what a first week!  Overwhelmed for sure, but this is the place I ought to be!  More later...
